      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love all things creative. I love making music, DJing events, drawing & screen printing. I also love to cook, but more importantly, EAT!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Working with a team that develops and creates worlds for RPG video games like Zelda would be sick!</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I had major interest in web design when I was younger. As time went on, I started to think about how cool it would be to be able to do more than just design. Learning how to build websites from start to finish would open many more doors for me. It's an immersive world, I believe I could use my creativity as fuel for.</p>
